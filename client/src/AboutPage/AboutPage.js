              During my practice, I have researched how food can contribute to
              macular (visual) health. For example, lutein and zeaxanthin are
              important nutrients found in leafy greens and yellow, orange and
              red bell peppers. Studies have shown these nutrients reduce the
              risk of eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration
              and cataracts. When these nutrients are consumed, the body
              deposits them in the macula creating a protective layer of macular
              pigment. These protective antioxidants work to absorb the blue
              light we are exposed to daily. They also allow eyes to tolerate
              and recover from bright flashes of light as well as provide the
              ability to see objects more clearly in dim light.

              Colorful vegetables and edible flowers often also contain Vitamin C, an
              antioxidant, which lowers the risk of developing cataracts and
              when taken in combination with other essential nutrients, can slow
              the progression of age-related macular degeneration and the
              resultant visual acuity loss. Vitamin C also supports healthy
              ocular blood vessels.

          <h4>Curb Appeal by Rheda</h4>
          <p >
            I happened into starting a gardening business in 2018 by offering to
            help an acquaintance with her corner lot flower bed spring clean-up
            while she was recuperating from back surgery. Once I started the
            project, we both realized there were many opportunities to add color
            and texture as well as minimize the upkeep of her landscape. While
            driving home one night, I drove by Colorado and Amherst to see the
            latest addition to the Vision Care Specialists office locations and
            was horrified by the weed overgrowth in the 2 raised bed planters. I
            was in contact with our CEO soon and informed him that I would clean
            up, plant and maintain those planters. Both of these gardens differ
            greatly from the small shade gardens I have at my residence. But
            Iâ€™ve come to love the color and vibrancy that perennials and annuals
            provide when planted in sunny locations.
